# RPRevamped-Small-v1.0

## Dataset Description

RPRevamped is a synthetic dataset generated by various numbers of models. It is very diverse and is recommended if you are fine-tuning a roleplay model. This is the `Small` version with `Medium` and `Tiny` version currently in work.

Hugging Face: [RPRevamped-Small](https://huggingface.co/datasets/TechPowerB/RPRevamped-Small)

Here's are the models used in creation of this dataset:
```txt
DeepSeek-V3-0324
Gemini-2.0-Flash-Thinking-Exp-01-21
DeepSeek-R1
Gemma-3-27B-it
Gemma-3-12B-it
Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct
Meta-Llama-3.1-405B
Llama-4-Maverick-17B-128E-Instruct
```

**This dataset was created using many steps before the final dataset was derived. These steps are:**

1. `Character Card Generation`
2. `Conversation Generation`
3. `Quality Control/Tagging`
4. `Rewriting of conversations based on QC`
5. `Chain Of Thoughts Generation`

            "passed": true,
            "quality_explanation": "Quality assessment"
        }
    }
}
````

## Content Diversity

The dataset covers a wide range of themes and genres (40+ genres and themes). These are (only 8 are listed):
```txt
1. mystery: 842 tagged
2. romance: 682 tagged

... More
```

### Content Analysis
The dataset is diverse as per the analysis done with on average topic similarity (LDA) of ~17.56% across all fields and lexical similarity (TF-IDF) of ~3.81% (Info section not included for these analysis)

## Dataset Creation Process

As mentioned earlier, The dataset was created with multiple steps before the final version was derived.

Below we go in depth on how the entire dataset was curated:

### Character Card Generation
We collected thousands of incomplete scenarios, personas, character cards from multiple sources and then used the model `Gemini-2.0-Flash-Thinking-Exp-01-21` to generate high quality character cards using it. The format of the character card that was generated from this was:

````json
{
    "name": "Character name",
    "persona": "Character description",
    "example_dialogues": "Example dialogues of character",
    "scenario": "Scenario description",
    "starter_message": "Initial message to begin conversation"
}
````

### Conversation Generation
Since, now we had thousands of high quality character cards (around ~3100 cards) we proceeded with generating conversations.

We used a mix of the following models:
```txt
DeepSeek-V3-0324
DeepSeek-R1
Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct
Meta-Llama-3.1-405B
Llama-4-Maverick-17B-128E-Instruct
```

We randomly selected a model to generate responses from the available models list. 
After this we filtered the dataset to remove any characters which didn't have a conversations list likely due to some errors. This left us with ~2800 character cards with conversations.

### Quality Control/Tagging
After the previous process it was followed by aggressive quality control and tagging. This step added the `info` section into the dataset which has the `quality_control` and `tags` sections.

A mix of the following models was used here:
```txt
Gemma-3-27B-it
Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct
```

This step was very strict regarding quality and disqualified any char/user responses with more or equal to 2 major problems. Any example which failed to go through quality control was marked by `passed: false`.
After this step we had two seperate datasets one was `failed_cards.json` and other one was `passed_cards.json`. With `passed_cards.json` having ~2100 examples and `failed_cards.json` having ~700 examples

### Rewriting of conversations based on QC
Quality control produced 2 seperate datasets as mentioned earlier. All examples in `passed_cards.json` was sent for CoT generation and all examples in `failed_cards.json` was sent for regeneration of conversations based on quality control.

This process of **Quality Control/Tagging** and **Rewriting of conversations based on QC** continued for multiple steps (3 steps in total). Until the final `failed_cards.json` was discarded and deleted. This left us with exactly **2,586** examples which went through the final step. The same models were used as in Quality Control/Tagging. This is why all characters are marked as `passed: true`

### Chain Of Thoughts Generation
This was the final step for the dataset. We used the mix of following models here:
```txt
DeepSeek-R1
Gemma-3-27B-it
Gemma-3-12B-it
Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Instruct
```

After processing, we filtered the dataset. Regenerated Chain Of Thoughts for the failed characters which helped us retain all **2,586** examples.

#### Data Processing/Health Check
This was used to check the dataset's health and check for any INCONSISTENCIES in the dataset (which was hopefully almost none!).

We used NetMind's API for the models and the free credits provided by them as well as Gemini API. The effective cost for generating the entire dataset was 0 USD for us!

The notebook used for checking the health of the dataset is included in the full GitHub repositry as well the prompts used to generate the content. Time taken to generate the entire dataset is ~1.3 weeks. **This dataset is not NSFW-focused**

Fun Fact: We found that `Gemma-3-27B-it` performed the best for roleplaying in our generation sessions.
