## ✅ TASK: Generate a **Chain of Thought (CoT)** that explains the system’s reasoning behind how to write each of `{{char}}`’s responses to the `{{user}}`.

---

### 🧠 INPUT FORMAT:
You will receive:

- **Character**: A full profile including:
  - **Name**
  - **Persona**: Includes tone, personality traits, values, speech style, quirks, goals, etc.
  - **Example Dialogues**
  - **Scenario**: The context in which the character is speaking (their role, situation, background setting).
  - **Starter Message**: The opening message from the character.

- **Conversations**: A back-and-forth dialogue between `{{user}}` and `{{char}}`.

---

### 🎯 OBJECTIVE:
For each message sent by `{{char}}`, generate a **Chain of Thought (CoT)** from an **OOC system-level perspective**.

This means: Think like the system planning how to respond **as {{char}}**, given the user’s input and the character’s defined traits.

You should simulate how the system reasons:
- "The user just said X"
- "The character’s persona says they are Y"
- "I could respond with A, B, or C…"
- "Let’s go with B because it best matches their tone and furthers the conversation."

The goal is to **explain the step-by-step decision-making process** behind crafting the most in-character and context-aware response.

---

### ✨ WHAT TO INCLUDE IN EACH CoT:
For every `{{char}}` response:

- Interpret what the user just said or implied
- Reference the **character’s persona** explicitly (e.g., “The persona says {{char}} is blunt and doesn’t sugarcoat things…”)
- Consider multiple possible responses and **weigh them**
- Show self-corrections: (e.g., “Hmm, that’s too polite… doesn’t fit the tone. Let’s revise.”)
- Justify the final choice: Why this exact response fits the persona, the conversation flow, and emotional tone
- Capture tone, pacing, and nuance appropriate to the scenario
- Chain of Thought should be **minimum 300 words**, and written as a **step-by-step internal reasoning process**

---

### 🧠 SYSTEM-STYLE CoT EXAMPLE:
```
## COT 1:
Okay, so the user just asked a sarcastic question. According to the persona, {{char}} is snarky and often responds with biting wit. One option could be to mirror the sarcasm, but escalate it slightly to show dominance. I originally thought about having {{char}} reply with “Obviously, genius,” but that feels a bit flat.

Wait—let’s remember: the persona says {{char}} “takes pleasure in mocking others, but also secretly craves validation.” So maybe the response should mock, but in a way that invites continued interaction.

Option A: “You really cracked the code there, Sherlock.”
Option B: “Wow, that took you only five years to figure out.”
Option C: “Cute. Try again.”

I like B best—it’s harsh but playful, keeps the energy up, and aligns with the tone. A feels too cliché. C is too dismissive—it might end the thread early.

Let’s go with B. It’s cutting, but leaves the door open.
```

### 📌 FORMAT:
YOU MUST FOLLOW THIS FORMAT TO GENERATE RESPONSES:
## COT 1:
{{Chain of thought for {{char}}'s first response}}

## COT 2:
{{Chain of thought for {{char}}'s second response}}

...continue

### 🛑 IMPORTANT RULES:
- Every CoT should be a **system-level, OOC breakdown** of the thinking process
- Mention the **character’s persona traits by name**
- Include **multiple candidate responses** and analysis of tone
- Include self-correction or revision if relevant
- Do **NOT** summarize the conversation
- Keep it focused on *how to generate the best in-character response*
- Add multiple paragraphs instead of making it a giant paragraph.

Here is the character and most importantly conversations:
