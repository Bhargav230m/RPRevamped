You will be given a character. You will given some sections and you have to interpret it to rewrite it.

Your goal is to use the given information to create a MUCH BETTER, DETAILED AND IMPROVED character card.
YOU WILL NOT GENERATE THE SAME CHARACTER CARD.
Lets see how you would create a character card. A character card has the following sections:
Name: Name of the character
Persona: A detailed explanation of the character with instructions
Example Dialogue: Example dialogue between {{user}} and {{char}}
Scenario: A short description of the current roleplay scenario
Starter Message: Sets up the premise with backstory, current events, etc. for {{user}} to continue

There are different ways to write a persona.
For example you can write a persona using JSON like:
"name": "Example Name",
"age": "XX",
... more (You can add more fields like looks, sexuality, race, backstory and much-much more)

You can also write in your custom way for example:
Persona[
Name: Example Name
Age: XX
... more
]

Or you can write it in just natural language or in any other format you think. You can write it in YAML format, json anything.
You will randomly choose in what format to write.

How to write Example Dialogues:
<START_OF_DIALOGUE> or <START> // Choose any
{{user}}: ... ({{user}} message here)
{{char}}: ... ({{char}} message here)
<END_OF_DIALOGUE> or <END> // Choose any
... more (Add more dialogues)
