Your task is to analyze a character card and evaluate both **tags** and **dialogue quality** based on strict criteria.

---

### ✅ INPUT FORMAT:
You will receive the following structured data:

- `Name`: The character’s name  
- `Persona`: The character’s personality description and behavioral instructions  
- `Example Dialogues`: Sample one-on-one dialogues between `{{user}}` and `{{char}}`  
- `Scenario`: A roleplay scenario/backdrop for the character  
- `Starter Message`: A narrative introduction written by `{{char}}`, establishing context for roleplay  
- `Conversations`: Multiple turn-based conversations between `{{user}}` and `{{char}}`  

---

### 🎯 OBJECTIVES:

You must produce two outputs:

---

## 1. **Tags**

You must analyze all input content and extract relevant tags. Use the following format and strict limits:

```yaml
## Tags:
general_tags: ["tag1", "tag2", ..., max 15]
kink_tags: ["tag1", "tag2", ..., max 15] or ["none"]
fetish_tags: ["tag1", "tag2", ..., max 15] or ["none"]
```

- **General Tags:** Genre or theme tags like `sci-fi`, `fantasy`, `villain`, `detective`, `slice of life`, `90s`, `supernatural`, etc.  
- **Kink Tags:** Erotic preferences or roleplay tropes such as `dom/sub`, `breathplay`, `voyeurism`, `corruption`, etc. If none are present, write `["none"]`.
- **Fetish Tags:** Specific sexual interests such as `feet`, `tentacles`, `latex`, `ageplay`, `monster`, `nippleplay`, `size difference`, etc. If none are present, write `["none"]`.

🛑 **Do not hallucinate tags**. Use only what is implied or directly expressed in the source.

---

## 2. **Conversations Rating**

You must evaluate how well the example `Conversations` align with the `Persona` of the character. Check for consistency, dialogue quality, and realism.

Use this exact format:

```yaml
## Conversations Rating:
passed: True or False
Explanation:
<Your explanation goes here, this should be long and should also explain what can be improved to make it good>
```

---

### 🎯 Evaluation Criteria for Conversation Quality:

Be hypercritical and analytical. A conversation **fails** if any of the following are true:

#### ❌ Major Red Flags:
- **Character voice mismatch**: `{{char}}` is out-of-character based on the `Persona`
- **Dialogue repetition**: Emotional or verbal repetition without narrative progression
- **Shallow interaction**: Lack of layered interaction or emotional subtext
- **Bot-like exchanges**: Flat, robotic, or generic lines from either speaker
- **Filler tropes or clichés**: Overused or generic romantic/erotic lines (see banned phrases)
- **Imbalanced turns**: `{{char}}` replies under 60 words or `{{user}}` replies under 30 words consistently

#### ❌ BANNED PHRASES (MUST NOT APPEAR):
These exact lines **must never appear**:

```
"Tucks a strand of {{user}} hair behind the ear"
"All I want is to protect you and keep you safe"
"Are you sure you want this?"
"There was a silent understanding between them"
"You have no idea what you're doing to me"
"You're playing with fire"
"What is it, that keeps you busy?"
"Tell me about yourself"
"So tell me, what keeps you coming back to this place?"
"She looked so fragile/vulnerable"
"Her/his hot breath on his/her ears"
"{{char}} awaits {{user}}'s response with bated breath"
```

#### ❌ Over-description:
- Avoid excessive focus on physical traits (eyes, breath, lips) unless *persona-appropriate* and *well-varied*

#### ✅ Must Haves:
- Consistent character behavior in line with persona  
- Natural, human-feeling dialogue — not generic roleplay
- Varied sentence structure and emotional tone  
- Emotional/narrative **progression** in each response

> If **4 or more major issues** are found, mark the conversation as `passed: False`.

---

### ✅ Final Output Format

Your final answer must strictly follow this format:

```
## Tags:
general_tags: ["..."]
kink_tags: ["..."]
fetish_tags: ["..."]

## Conversations Rating:
passed: True or False
Explanation:
