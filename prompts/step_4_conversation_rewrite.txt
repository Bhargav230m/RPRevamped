Your job is to **rewrite the conversations** to pass all quality checks while **preserving the character‚Äôs unique voice, behavior, and scenario context**.

---

### üß† INPUT FORMAT:
You will be given:

- `Character`: Includes Name, Persona, Example Dialogues, Scenario, and Starter Message
- `Conversations`: A set of dialogue exchanges between {{user}} and {{char}} that failed to meet standards
- `Quality_Control`: A structured critique of what failed (banned phrases, voice issues, pacing, etc.)

---

### üéØ OBJECTIVE:
You must **rewrite ONLY the conversations**, fixing the problems described in `quality_control`.
You can also write the conversations from scratch if you think the current conversations are not good and cannot be modified to fit the Quality Control Prompt.
~~~You MUST change responses of both {{user}} and {{char}} and you have to rewrite from SCRATCH.~~~

Do **not** modify the Persona, Scenario, or Starter. Just focus on rewriting conversations.

Be hypercritical and analytical. A conversation **fails** if any of the following are true:
#### ‚ùå Major Red Flags:
- **Character voice mismatch**: `{{char}}` is out-of-character based on the `Persona`
- **Dialogue repetition**: Emotional or verbal repetition without narrative progression
- **Shallow interaction**: Lack of layered interaction or emotional subtext
- **Bot-like exchanges**: Flat, robotic, or generic lines from either speaker
- **Filler tropes or clich√©s**: Overused or generic romantic/erotic lines (see banned phrases)
- **Imbalanced turns**: `{{char}}` replies under 80 words or `{{user}}` replies under 50 words consistently
- **Not Enough Words**: if {{char}} responses are below 80 words or {{user}} responses are below 50 words then conversation fails.

#### ‚ùå BANNED PHRASES (MUST NOT APPEAR):
These exact lines **must never appear**:

```
"Tucks a strand of {{user}} hair behind the ear"
"All I want is to protect you and keep you safe"
"Are you sure you want this?"
"There was a silent understanding between them"
"You have no idea what you're doing to me"
"You're playing with fire"
"What is it, that keeps you busy?"
"Tell me about yourself"
"So tell me, what keeps you coming back to this place?"
"She looked so fragile/vulnerable"
"Her/his hot breath on his/her ears"
"{{char}} awaits {{user}}'s response with bated breath"
```

#### ‚ùå Over-description:
- Avoid excessive focus on physical traits (eyes, breath, lips) unless *persona-appropriate* and *well-varied*

#### ‚úÖ Must Haves:
- Consistent character behavior in line with persona
- Natural, human-feeling dialogue ‚Äî not generic roleplay
- Varied sentence structure and emotional tone
- Emotional/narrative **progression** in each response
- ~!!YOU MUST KEEP {{char}} responses long (above <80 words) and same with {{user}} responses (above <50 words)!!~
- You MUST change the responses accordingly to Quality Control
- Take Quality Control prompt EXTREMELY SERIOUSLY and fix the problems

How to respond?
You just have to respond with the rewritten conversations and nothing else.
Follow this format:
## Dialogue 1
{{user}}: *rewritten message*
{{char}}: *rewritten response*

## Dialogue 2
{{user}}: *rewritten message*
{{char}}: *rewritten response*
